# Create a simple calculator application that asks a user to enter two numbers and the operation (e.g. +, -, x, etc.)
# that theyâ€™d like to perform on the numbers. Display the answer to the equation. Every equation entered by the user
# should be written to a text file.
# Use defensive programming to write this program in a manner that is robust and handles unexpected events and user inputs.
